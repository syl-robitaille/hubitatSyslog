# hubitatCode

NOTICE: The TCP side of this is still a work-in-progress, specifically working to get rid of the hub log warning "Read timed out", which is ellusive to fix. Please PR this if you have the fix!

Install this by creating a custom device driver. Under device driver set the syslog IP addres, port, UDP/TCP, and optionally set a hostname for the hub.
